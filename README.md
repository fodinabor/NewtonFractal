# NewtonFractal
A Newton Fractal Generator. Using OpenCL and Polycode (http://polycode.org)

To run you need an OpenCL Device and a Driver. If you don't already have one I'd recommend to install Intels OpenCL Runtime - works for Intel and AMD CPUs! (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers)

Currently there are only Windows Binaries and build files.
